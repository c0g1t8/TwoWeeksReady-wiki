Family Plan - DRAFT

The 2WeeksReady (2WR) Family Plan section is an important part of the application. The requirements for this feature are listed below following a brief description of the section. 

The family plan provides users and their identified group a shared resource document with contact information, actions to take (like calling outside region contact person to check in), where to meet up if separated, what to do if you are at home or identified location (work, office, school, place of worship, etc) and provide instructions such as, where and how to turn off gas, water, electrical panel, fire extinguisher locations, emergency contact information, special instructions, etc. This information can be provided in pre built ask/answer style workflows or other recommended structure types. 

The family plan is a user controlled text segment (contents detailed more below) that provides the user and its identified invitees to access the contents of the family plan document within their 2WR application, on and off line from data connectivity.  

The segment will need to have the following access privileges
* owner
* editor
* viewer

The 2WR application on a device might have ownership, access and/or viewer rights to multiple family plans from different "family plan" groups. 

Contents of the "family plan" section include user editable details, such as; 
* Who (identified users that are shared on this plan) is listed
* In the event of a disaster, do the following: Application provided suggestions during set up of family plan workflow.
  > examples include: check yourself and others for injuries; get to a safe place (high ground if near the coast after earthquake shaking stops); location of gas meter and how to turn off; meeting point locations and travel routes; communicate with out of area contact; location of go kits/emergency supplies; special medical needs; who to check on in the neighborhood (those with access and functional needs, children, elderly etc.); add any custom instructions or messages (words of encouragement to loved ones)
* Emergency contact information; name, number, address, text, email, special information 

Need to decide: Which items are considered “Required” in order to make a family plan “completed?
-Include Some sort of prompt for information about why this is useful to get them started, like “an emergency just happened to you: who is the first person you can think of who needs to know about it?” and “Who is someone who you would really need to know if something happened to you suddenly” (bad example wording, but a couple of prompts like this would really help get the idea of who to put in My Family Plan.



**Ask for people to add their emergency contacts when people first click on/open the My Family Plan feature/button** Also, it will include language explaining why you need to add in the emergency contacts and that whomever you include will also get your last known location** >MD

What is My Family Plan? 
My Family Plan is a tool to document important information for your friends, family, and members of your household for use during a disaster. Use this Family Plan to create a record of your important information, like work and school phone numbers, emergency contact information, medical contacts, and pet identification.

How to use My Family Plan
Talk with the members of your household about what information you would each need in an emergency. Fill in your important information and share it with your family members. 

As a household, choose an out-of-area contact person, someone who lives outside of your state, and add their information as your emergency contact. If an earthquake happens in your area and you receive a ShakeAlert message, a notification will be sent to your designated emergency contact with your last known location.
