`Family Plan - DRAFT

The 2WeeksReady (2WR) Family Plan section is an important part of the application. The requirements for this feature are listed below following a brief description of the section. 

The family plan provides users and their identified group a shared resource document with contact information, actions to take (like calling outside region contact person to check in), where to meet up if separated, what to do if you are at home or identified location (work, office, school, place of worship, etc) and provide instructions such as, where and how to turn off gas, water, electrical panel, fire extinguisher locations, emergency contact information, special instructions, etc. This information can be provided in pre built ask/answer style workflows or other recommended structure types. 

The family plan is a user controlled text segment (contents detailed more below) that provides the user and its identified invitees to access the contents of the family plan document within their 2WR application, on and off line from data connectivity.  

The segment will need to have the following access privileges
* owner
* editor
* viewer

The 2WR application on a device might have ownership, access and/or viewer rights to multiple family plans from different "family plan" groups. 

Include Some sort of prompt for information about why this is useful to get them started, like “an emergency just happened to you: who is the first person you can think of who needs to know about it?”
