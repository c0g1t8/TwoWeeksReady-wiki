The main landing page should have a section for each feature of the application: My Family Plan, Emergency Kits, Hazard Hunt and Hazard Information.

Each feature listed above will be displayed in a list with rich content containing at minimum a title and a description.

The Family Plan and Emergency Kits items should also have quick-links to established plans, or kits (up to 2 or 3).

The interface should have a taskbar with quick-links to recent events and account settings.
